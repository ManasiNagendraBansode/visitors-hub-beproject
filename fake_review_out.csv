1,"Nice, spicy and tender.	1 Good prices.	1 Check it out.	1 It was pretty gross!	0 I've had better atmosphere.	0 Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0 Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0 I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0 Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0 Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	1 The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	1 We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	1 Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0 Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0 Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1 I wouldn't return.	0 Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	1 This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0 Penne vodka excellent!	1 They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.	1 The management is rude.	0 Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	1 Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	1 I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1 This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1 He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0 My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1 Don't do it!!!!	0 The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0 My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0 And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0 Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1 The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	1 The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	0 The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	0 I give it 2 thumbs down	0 We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0 My fiancï¿½ and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1 This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.	1 We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0 Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0 Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1 the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1 this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1 I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	1 this place is good.	1 Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0 I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0 I was seated immediately.	1 Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1 Avoid at all cost!	0 Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1 DELICIOUS!!	1 This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1 So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0 I've never been treated so bad.	0 Bacon is hella salty.	1 We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0 This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1 The waitresses are very friendly.	1 Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1 Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1 Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0 The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0 The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1 Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1 We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0 The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0 I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0 I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0 It was probably dirt.	0 Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	1 I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1 The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0 Interesting decor.	1 What I really like there is the crepe station.	1 Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	1 you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1 Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	1 When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0 I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	1 I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0 The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	1 The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0 I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0 Very friendly staff.	1 It is worth the drive.	1 I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	1 Food was great and so was the serivce!	1 The warm beer didn't help.	0 Great brunch spot.	1 Service is friendly and inviting.	1 Very good lunch spot.	1 I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	0 The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0 Must have been an off night at this place.	0 The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	1 If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0 For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0 My friend loved the salmon tartar.	1 Won't go back.	0 Extremely Tasty!	1 Waitress was good though!	1",Orchid,Pune,Aditya,0,1,0,0,1,0
